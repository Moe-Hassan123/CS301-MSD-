     Advertising under the Fair Housing Act doesn’t just mean ads in newspapers.
     The law says you can’t “make, print, or publish. . . any notice, statement, or advertisement . . .
     that indicates any preference, limitation, or discrimination based on a person’s race, color, religion, sex, handicap,
     familial status, or national origin.” That includes such things as applications, flyers, brochures, deeds, signs, banners, posters,
     billboards, and even pictures in your office.

    It also means that the things you say about your property in writing,
      over the phone or in person are covered.
      Expressing an illegal preference or limitation to one of your fellow agents, brokers, employees, prospective sellers, renters,
      or to any other person in connection with the sale or rental of your property is illegal. Here are two examples of illegal advertising
      that you may not have realized were violations of the Fair Housing Act.
