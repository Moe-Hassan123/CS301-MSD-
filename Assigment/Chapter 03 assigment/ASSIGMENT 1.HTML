    <h1>My Story </h1>
<p> 
        The United States was not a dream for me but that does not mean I do not like it.
         My friend applied for me with six others, but no one is been selected. 
         I completed the process and now I am hear by myself with no family, living my American dream chasing the dollar.
         Thatâ€™s was my paradigm shift.
         The smell of the air, the food, the people, and the streets everything is different from my country, although,
         I had seen so many movies about the Sates, which somehow helped as background. I had some family members they are 
         not first blood related but they did helped me. As am living and adapting to my new life. I found that the only way to
         have decent life in the America is either by having a good job or by establishing your own business, Although, I had my degree
         with me and it is equivalent to the united state bachelor degree in architecture. I was not lucky in getting a job. I forget 
         adding my friend Saad Shaigy who I met while I was coming to the United States. He helped me to and convinced me to go to school
        .Actually, he is the one who told me about Maharishi University of Management.</p>
